## Overview 🔍
Frshly_Ground is a local cafe that is loved by coffee enthusiats and book lovers. A chilling spot,that combines both nature and knowledge.  
The Cafe relied on outdated on-premises systems and limited digital infrastructure thus making running the cafe's manual operations slow, 
and the system would shutdown and leading to less exposure due to their website not reaching the right audience and less customer engagement.
They also had no reliable system for data backup and recovery.In a modern, digital-first world, this made it difficult to grow, scale, and 
compete with other cafes that already had strong online platforms. Due to their on-premises problems,they had a lot of downtime,inefficient daily operations and would often lose data.
